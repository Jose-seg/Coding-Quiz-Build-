# Coding-Quiz-Build-

## Description 
In this assigment we needed to create a web quiz using html, css, and javascript in order to create a functional quiz. I made mine as simple as it can be so that I can add more to it as I practice my skills. I do intend on adding more questions and answers so that this quiz can be a grounds for me to study. 

## Usage
The usage of the web quiz app is to give the user (myself) a method of studying the things I've learned in the course. At the moment the quiz has only 4 questions I do plan on adding more once I get the free time and knowledge to do so. This is intended to be a test run for a better quiz i intend to make.
